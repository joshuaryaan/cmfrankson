            <h2><b>Visual Manipulation</b></h2>
            <p>Visual Manipulation warps the interpretation of space by investigating the relationship between flat compositional representations of space and 3-dimensional interventions. Driven by the Maori concept of Turangawaewae – A Place to Stand, experimentation of the viewer’s position and the alternate spatial experience given to the viewer create the artistic expression that is Visual Manipulation. This experimentation is an adaptation of the illusionistic qualities of deciphering space, considerate of techniques used in painting and other fine arts; an affinity between architecture, spatial design and painting. Experimental development of a linear and planar language is used to express a qualitative analysis in the performance of light and geometry for tangibility and viewer perception. Localized in the Kuku Stream Sheds, the proposed installations play with personal and spatial identity.</p>
            <p class="highlight"><i>Sensibility: refers to an acute perception of or responsiveness toward something, such as emotions of another... associated with sense perception as the means through which information is gathered.
            <br>Spatial sensibility: atmosphere – sensorial qualities that a space emits – an immediate form of physical perception, and is recognized through emotional sensibility.</i></p>
            <h2>1. Breaking the Frame</h2>
            <p>Photographed in a manner which presents the sketch models as flat compositions, the inclusion of people and furniture "breaks the frame" and allows a spatial quality to be read through contextualisation and scale. This creates a certain depth of field and changes viewer perception in terms of scale and sensibility. The composition must be inhabited in order to be understood both spatially and atmospherically. The space transforms the person in their perception, likewise, the space is being transformed by the user/viewer. Atmospherically this entails a degree of identifying oneself within the space, where the challenge is facing the obscure scale in manipulating perception.</p>
